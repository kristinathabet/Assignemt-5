# DH150 Assignment 6: Low-Fidelity Prototype by Kristina Thabet

## Overview

### Purpose 
Low-fidelity prototyping is a quick and inexpensive way to test user interactions before fully investing in creating a product. Low-Fidelity prototyping is usually hand drawn mockups and does not involve actual user interaction. This is important in order to gain feedback from users and uncover problems before a lot of money in invested into making a fully product. This is the best stage of the design process to make large adjustments to the design, once developers can see the physical wireflow of the application.

By making low-fidelity prototypes for project, I can test the functionality of my design with users and make further adjustments to the design before working on the high-fidelity prototypes.

### User Research
Based on my contextual inquiry, I will focus on these three research questions:
* How can we improve thiss website in order to easily find all paperwork needed to obtain a license in New York?
* How might we make others feel more in line with their identity, making sure all information on their license is accurate?
* How might we create an intuitive design that users can interact with effortlessly?

Here is more information on the [user research](https://github.com/kristinathabet/Dh110-Assignment-4-Contextual-inquiry/blob/main/README.md).

### Personas and Scenarios
I created personas and scenarios centered around features that would solve each research question.
* A man with medium technical literacy and wants to have transparent and timely updates on his reports.
* A new undergraduate with high technical literacy and wants to browse and search for other reports in her community.
* An elderly woman with low technical literacy and wants to submit reports quickly and effortlessly.

### Reflection
I enjoyed drawing the wireframes and designing how I'd like it to look like. When I want to add some buttoms or features, I searched online to see how they look like that way I can replicate it. Putting my ideas onto paper is harder than I thought but it is a fun process nonetheless. When I draw the wireflows, I can see what I need to add to the wireframes. From testing the prototype, I found even more missed elements in the wireframes, such as a **Next** button rather than just a **Skip** button.  

The next time I create wireframes and wireflows, I would make a flow chart with just words so I can visualize the entire sequence in order to include all the buttons. For this prototype, I would need to add all the buttons and draw the wireframes for all the other buttons I included but were not going to be tested. If I need to be more detailed, I would draw dropdown menus to wireframes that have them too. 

By only creating one type of sequence (e.g. one sequence to make a report on an abandoned car), I guide the participant into pressing the only button they can choose so I can realize the importance of drawing all the wireframes of the app that way they can have a near complete experience. I would also have the participant draw the flow and mark the mistakes/confusion on the actual wireframe itself instead of doing it for them.
