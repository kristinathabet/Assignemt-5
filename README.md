# DH110 Assignment 5: Low-Fidelity Prototype by Kristina Thabet

## Overview

### Purpose 
Low-fidelity prototyping is a quick and inexpensive way to test user interactions before fully investing in creating a product. Low-Fidelity prototyping is usually hand drawn mockups and does not involve actual user interaction. This is important in order to gain feedback from users and uncover problems before a lot of money in invested into making a fully product. This is the best stage of the design process to make large adjustments to the design, once developers can see the physical wireflow of the application.

By making low-fidelity prototypes for project, I can test the functionality of my design with users and make further adjustments to the design before working on the high-fidelity prototypes.

### User Research
Based on my contextual inquiry, I will focus on these three research questions:
* How can we improve thiss website in order to easily find all paperwork needed to obtain a license in New York?
* How might we make others feel more in line with their identity, making sure all information on their license is accurate?
* How might we create an intuitive design that users can interact with effortlessly?

Here is more information on the [user research](https://github.com/kristinathabet/Dh110-Assignment-4-Contextual-inquiry/blob/main/README.md).

### Personas and Scenarios
I created personas and scenarios centered around certain features that would solve each research question.
* A new internet personality who is rising to stardom and wishes to change his name on his license to his new legal name.
* A high school senior who needs to obtain her license to secure her styling internship. She is immunocompromized and cannot user public transportation due to the rapid spread of COVID19.
* An elderly woman with low technical literacy who wants to check if her medical conditions will hinder her to legally drive in the state of New York. 

Here is more information on the [personas and scenarios](https://github.com/kristinathabet/PersonasWEEK6/blob/main/README.md).

### Tasks/Features
1. Find steps to obtain a New York license
2. Change the name on a license
3. Find information about medical conditions that hinder legal and safe driving

## Wireframes and Wireflows
### 1: Find steps to obtain a license

## Low-Fidelity Prototype Testing
### User's Reaction to the Testing
This prototype was fairly easy for my user to interact with. After explaining to the user what the system was supposed to do, they followed the arrows and used their logic to flow from one wireframe to the other. The only points of confusion were when the user attempted to go to the "Ask a Question Page" and there was no wireframe that followed it. The user did not notice that back arrow that takes you back to the previous page you were at, which could have been used to redirect from the questions page. Below are some photos of my user working through the three low-fidelity prototypes.

### Reflection
I enjoyed thinking about the most logical way to flow through the wireframe I created. I found it very difficult to create detailed low-fidelity protoypes that stemed from the New York DMV website because there are so many different options and buttons that can be included. It was also challenging doing the prototype on paper because you can add less words that way and everything needs to be very legible. This activity overall gave me a new perspective of the prototype I created. Having an outside user interact with my wireframe showed me that not everyone has the same logical thought process as me, so my design needs to be as clear and intuitive as possible. The next time I create wireframes and wireflows, I would do a first draft where I write in words every step that needs to be done, so I make sure to add all appropriate buttons. Also, I will make sure to draw arrows for every option that is clickable, instead of just drawing arrows directly to what will complete the task I wanted the user to complete.
Below I will address the confusion the user had with each of these tasks, and how I will improve it in the future. 
* 1. Find steps to obtain a New York license: The user= struggled to decifer weatehr the words on the wireframe were buttons you can click on or just general information laid out on the page. Moving forward, I will make she it is clear which words are buttons and which are not. 
* 2. Change the name on a license: The user was confused whether or not she should follow the "Standard ID" tab or the "Real ID" tab. Moving forward, I will define the difference between the two on the same page, making it easy for users to make a decision. 
* 3. Find information about medical conditions that hinder legal and safe driving: This wireflow was generally very intuitve for the user. Not many issues arose, but I will make sure to be much more detailed in the option choices moving forward. 
Overall, this assignment gave me a fresh perspective about how users will interact with my prototype.
